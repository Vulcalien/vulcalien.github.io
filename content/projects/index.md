A list of the best personal projects I've developed so far.

### Game Boy Advance
- [Minicraft for GBA](minicraft-gba): a demake of *Minicraft*, a small
  game made by Markus Persson for the Ludum Dare 22 competition.

### Various
- [libcliscreen](libcliscreen): a C library that allows using the
  terminal window as a raster screen, to make terminal games or
  applications.
- [6502-emulators](6502-emulators): two emulators for the 8-bit
  processor MOS 6502, one of which written entirely in ARM assembly for
  the Game Boy Advance.
