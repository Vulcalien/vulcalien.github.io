Minicraft for GBA is a demake of the game
[Minicraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minicraft), made by Notch for
the 22nd Ludum Dare.

When I started coding, studying the source code of Minicraft helped me
learn the basics of how a videogame is made. I thus decided that my
first project for the Game Boy Advance would be a demake of Minicraft.

Porting the game to the relatively less powerful console brought with it
some technical challenges, so I had to be careful not to overuse
precious resources such as CPU clocks or RAM. After spending much time
learning how to best use the GBA's hardware and optimizing the game so
that it could run smoothly, I ended up with a game that is very close
to the original.

### What I learned

Firstly, I learned how to write games for the Game Boy Advance, a
platform that is surprisingly enjoyable to code for. Since the GBA has
no Operating System, I also had to learn how to directly interact with
the hardware through hardware registers.
