When a videogame is sold with a physical box, that box is decorated by
an image that represents the game. Such image can also be used when
publishing games online. Specifically for Game Boy Advance games, the
box's front side is square and has, to the left, a label indicating what
console the game is for. For example, this is the box cover of
'Minicraft for GBA'.

I decided to redraw that left-side label in SVG format, making it much
easier to modify than if it were in a bitmap format. I publish this
image in the hope that someone else might find this useful.
